          <p>At a time where COVID-19 fatigue has been at an all time high, and the discovery of COVID-19 variants from many places around the world which may have higher ability to transmit from person to person, many Canadians are wondering how soon they’ll get an injection of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. 
            <br><br>
            The current global data puts Canada at a somewhat embarrassing place on the global stage. Israel has vaccinated enough people for life to begin to look somewhat normal again. Americans are vaccinating more people everyday than the total amount of Canadians vaccinated to date. With only 2.8% of Canadians receiving their first dose and 1% of Canadians receiving both required doses under current guidelines, there is much to say about the seemingly lacking rollout plan. 
            <br><br>
            There are many factors which contribute to the success of Canada’s current vaccine infrastructure, such as contract bargaining and vaccine availability. Vaccine nationalism has also become a problem, and the large discrepancy between Canada’s and the United States’ vaccine rates can be attributed to the United States’ bargaining and production power. A slowdown of vaccine availability from production capacities and global stock does not however relinquish the government from being responsible for the sluggish rates of national vaccination. 
            <br><br>
            Last year in May Canada promised a secured vaccine supply from CanSino, a vaccine company based in China, which would provide shipments of vaccines to Canada, and eventually start vaccine production domestically. However because of political tensions from the arrest of Meng Wangzhou in Vancouver, the Chinese government abruptly halted the first shipment of vaccines to Canada. 
            <br><br>
            In August of 2020 is when the Canadian government finally announced deals to acquire Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and start vital shipments to vaccinate Canadians.
            <br><br>
            Many believe that the vaccine supply has not met the Government's promises of a secured supply, as doses ordered seem to be vastly cut or delayed. Further frustrations stemming from issues such as poverty, mental health and economy, exacerbated by the pandemic have amplified calls for a more robust and organized vaccine rollout. 
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately there is further evidence that the government turned down other domestic plans for vaccine production adding to frustrations. It seems as though the government did not fully consider its options during this procurement crisis. The government instead is investing in a centralized facility in Montreal, which the government acknowledges the plan's failures to meet current targets.
            <br><br>
            Canadians are still on edge as they anxiously await more shipments of vaccines to come. As plans for a mass vaccination campaign roll forward very soon, many are wondering if the government can actually keep up with their promises.
