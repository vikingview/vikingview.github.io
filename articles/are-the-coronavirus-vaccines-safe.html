          <p>A typical vaccine takes roughly ten years to create, yet the coronavirus vaccines were created in less than one. Some Canadians express their concerns on how expeditiously the vaccines were produced but experts emphasize that all phases of clinical trials have been thoroughly assessed and met Canada’s vaccine requirements. Although mild side effects include headache, muscle ache, chills, fever, nausea, and tiredness, Health Canada stated there are no immediate safety concerns unless an individual is allergic to any of the active ingredients.
          <br><br>
          On December 9, Health Canada authorized Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for Canadians aged 16 or older. The vaccine is two shots taken 21 days apart and showed the efficacy of 95 percent. 249,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be shipped despite having a rigid cold chain requirement (between -60°C and -80°C) and must be used within five days before they are inactivated or become less effective.
          Erin O’Toole’s first 100 days have not gone without issues. Most recently, controversial Tory MP Derek Sloan sponsored a House of Commons petition (e-2961) questioning the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine. The petition claims that “the Government of Canada does not conduct independent safety testing of vaccines” and the “COVID-19 vaccine development is being rushed.” For several days, O’Toole faced tough questions from reporters and Liberal MPs, dodging the idea of whether Sloan would be disciplined or face caucus removal. In September, O’Toole and his wife Rebecca tested positive for COVID-19.  This caused him to miss several days of sittings and party meetings in the House of Commons. This was also the catalyst for O’Toole to accuse the government and its inaction on rapid testing.
          <br><br>
          Two weeks later, the government authorized Moderna’s vaccine for Canadians aged 18 and older. The first dose of the vaccine is roughly 80 percent effective and the second dose, taken 28 days later, is 94.1 percent effective. 168,000 doses of Moderna’s vaccines are anticipated to be delivered by the end of the year. Unlike Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine, Moderna’s can be stored at regular freezer temperature (-20°C) for thirty days. As a result, the vaccine can be delivered to remote communities such as the Northern regions and smaller hospitals that do not have ultracold freezers, ensuring that more Canadians will have access.
          <br><br>
          Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have used mRNA technology to create their vaccines. mRNA technology is not unheard of and has been researched for approximately 30 years, but the coronavirus vaccines are the first to complete clinical trials and licensed for use. Traditional methods involve injecting inactivated doses of the disease-causing organism or the protein that it produces into the body to stimulate the immune system to respond to the infectious agent if an individual has been exposed. Conversely, the coronavirus vaccines use a synthesized mRNA sequence to provide information to the cell to create proteins by itself, signalling the immune system to produce antibodies. In comparison, mRNA vaccines can be produced more quickly at lower costs and cause fewer side effects, making this a remarkable advancement in vaccinology.
          <br><br>
          Nevertheless, the long-term immune response after vaccination is still unknown. Even so, experts have determined that the benefits outweigh the risks. Clinical trials are currently underway for adolescents aged 12 to 17 and vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson are under review. Despite the coronavirus situation aggravating worldwide, the vaccines are a light at the end of the tunnel that gives people hope of returning to their ordinary lives.
