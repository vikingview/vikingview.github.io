          <p>In December 2020, British Columbia announced their COVID-19 Immunization Plan that would take place over the course of the next several months, spanning the majority of the 2021 year. The vaccines currently come from Pfizer and Moderna, and more vaccines are expected to be available as other vaccines continue to be tested and approved.
          <br><br>
          The Immunization Plan is scheduled to take place in four phases, starting with phase 1 from December 2020 to February of this year and Phase 2 from February to March. These time periods have been allocated for those who are in the high-risk population, which includes those who have chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease, and heart disease. Phase 3 and phase 4, determined as phases concerning the general population, have been scheduled to take place from April 2021 to June 2021 and July to September 2021, respectively. Phase 4 consists of the most diverse group by age, ranging from people aged 59 to 18.
          <br><br>
          While there is debate around which individuals should be receiving vaccine doses before others, the BC government has stated that they are following national ethical frameworks and BCCDC’s COVID-19 Ethical Decision-Making Framework to distribute vaccines as ethically and equitably as possible. Additionally, the NACI, British Columbia’s Immunization Committee and the public health leadership committee, have recommended that certain populations should be prioritized to receive their vaccinations earlier.
          <br><br>
          Immunization for COVID-19 remains free for everyone eligible to receive it. Once a phase is over, everyone eligible will continue to be eligible to receive their vaccine doses. Currently, all approved COVID-19 vaccines in Canada require two doses per person. Once a person registers and receives their first dose, they will be contacted for their second. Since supply is limited, the timeline between receiving the first and second dose has been extended to accommodate more individuals receiving at least one of the required doses.
          <br><br>
          Hopefully, with the cooperation of both citizens and government, the phases can be carried out as efficiently as possible, provided there are no other setbacks. While the timeline of the phases may change due to the availability of vaccines, the more definite schedule may be seen by others as a beacon of hope for normalcy.
