          <p>Erin O’Toole is an unknown figure to many Canadians outside the “Ottawa bubble,” and he knows that. On August 23rd and 24th, the MP for Durham succeeded in making Andrew Scheer the leader of the Conservative Party and Canada’s Official Opposition. With more than 57% of the final leadership vote, O’Toole handily defeated the perceived frontrunner, Peter MacKay.  Since then, conflict between him and the Liberals has been present in the House of Commons over their COVID - 19 response. He has also been hitting the airwaves across the country to introduce himself. Will all this work pay off for O’Toole’s Conservatives in the next election?
          <br><br>
          The biggest hurdle for the 47-year-old leader Erin O’Toole is name recognition and personal values. He must contend with Justin Trudeau and Jagmeet Singh, arguably more well-known figures. As an MP representing a Toronto area riding since 2012,  O’Toole briefly served in the Harper cabinet as Canada’s minister of veteran’s affairs. Before his career in politics, he served as a captain for 12 years in the Royal Canadian Air Force. The soft-spoken Ontario MP has been trying to rebrand his party following the leadership of Andrew Scheer, a devout Roman Catholic.  Many people are against Screer’s personal views on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, while on the contrary, O’Toole belives that he is a better leader when it comes to LGBTQ+ and other sensitive He does not identify with the social conservative wing of his party but says “the rights of Canadians must be respected.” To make his stances clear, he travelled to battleground regions of the country: places the party must win seats to form a government. O’Toole’s largest public appearances by far have been in the progressive province of Quebec. He made an appearance on Radio-Canada’s Tout le monde en parle, a popular Sunday night talk show. There, he outlined his plan for Quebec and answered tough questions from his hosts on the protection of Quebec’s rights. The defunding of the English CBC, but not the French Radio-Canada, was a hot-button issue on the show. In a meeting with Quebec Premier François Legault, O’Toole said that he hopes to “triple” his party’s seat count in the province to 30/78.
          <br><br>
           Erin O’Toole’s first 100 days have not gone without issues. Most recently, controversial Tory MP Derek Sloan sponsored a House of Commons petition (e-2961) questioning the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine. The petition claims that “the Government of Canada does not conduct independent safety testing of vaccines” and the “COVID-19 vaccine development is being rushed.” For several days, O’Toole faced tough questions from reporters and Liberal MPs, dodging the idea of whether Sloan would be disciplined or face caucus removal. In September, O’Toole and his wife Rebecca tested positive for COVID-19.  This caused him to miss several days of sittings and party meetings in the House of Commons. This was also the catalyst for O’Toole to accuse the government and its inaction on rapid testing.
          <br><br>
          Erin O’Toole must continue introducing himself to reconstruct his party’s positive image if he wants to form a conservative government. Addressing non-reliable conservative voters, O’Toole said he “[wants] more Canadians to see a Conservative in the mirror.” While the polls currently put the Conservatives in a distant second behind the Liberals, only time will tell which leader has earned the right to govern Canada.</p>
