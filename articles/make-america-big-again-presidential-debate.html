          <p>The 2020 United States presidential election was held on Tuesday, November 3 2020. With Joe Biden representing the Democratic Party, and Donald Trump representing the Republic Party, this year’s presidential election was both unique and erratic. Many people in the U.S. and other countries expect a president to be a strong and responsible representative of their country, but who will be the best choice? Who can “make America big again?” With so many public health issues occurnig throughout the year, the votes may be swayed by the candidate's stances on healthcare.
          <br><br>
          The 2020 presidential debate was entertaining. Certain phrases such as “shut up, man” and “keep yapping, man” took the audience by surprise, but there were also serious moments in the debate that allowed the listeners to make a decision on who to vote — in particular: the topic of COVID-19 and healthcare. Each candidate was provided with two minutes to speak, followed by open discussion. With Biden starting off, he believed that a “dark winter” was about to approach, and with Donald Trump as president, the cases would only rise. Biden also claimed that Trump had no clear plan for vaccine rollout. Trump pushed back and said that he was doing a wonderful job of controlling the coronavirus and that Biden was overreacting. “I don’t think we have a dark winter at all. We’re opening up our country, we’ve learned and studied the disease, which we didn’t at the beginning,” Trump stated. Immediately the conflict between the two candidates began, both hurling insults at each other. This resulted in only twenty minutes of debate about the coronavirus (the longest segment) and throughout the debate, Trump interrupted Biden 73 times. The next crucial topic was the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as “Obamacare.” Obamacare was introduced to America by President Barack Obama in 2010. Its purpose was to ensure that all Amercans would receive health insurance and lower the cost of health care. However, if the Supreme Court rules the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, Biden’s next move is to “pass Obamacare with the public option: Bidencare.” Biden claimed that “under his plan, the public option would mean that if you qualify for Medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you are automatically enrolled.”  Trump interrupted and said that “he’d like to terminate Obamacare and come up with a new health care system, always protecting people with preexisting conditions, but doesn’t say what he will do.
          <br><br>
          Though we cannot compare the different visions between Trump and Biden, we can compare Trumpcare (AHCA) and Obamacare (ACA). Trumpcare is much more supported in the industry than Obamacare because Trumpcare cuts most taxes on industry, while Obamacare taxes those who profit the most out of healthcare. Obamacare allows all essential health benefit plans to be covered with no annual or lifetime limits, while Trumpcare has annual limits. This results in sick people who need essential care paying more or even being excluded from the market due to cost. Biden will continue to support Obamacare and claims that: even with Trump as the incumbent president, the Affordable Care Act is still a big deal. “Because of Obamacare, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have pre-existing conditions,” “As president, Biden will protect the Affordable Care Act from these continued attacks. He will oppose every effort to get rid of this historic legislation - including efforts by Republicans and Democrats. He has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate.”
          <br><br>
          There are many pros and cons between the ideas of Trump’s and Biden’s. Trumpcare is cheaper and provides a huge tax cut for the wealth, and Bidencare prioritizes  low-income Amercians.
          <br><br>
          306 electoral college votes were counted for Joe Biden and 232 votes for Donald Trump. Was it because Americans wanted change in America’s healthcare system and preferred Bidencare? Or was it because of socioeconomic reasons? Whether or not Biden can provide affordable health care to Americans, the people have decided that incivility and lying was not acceptable behaviour from their president. Americans  hope that with Biden as the 46th president of the United States, America will someday be great again.
